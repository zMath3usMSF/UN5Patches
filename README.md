# PAL to NTSC Patch
Patch that switches the game's video mode from PAL to NTSC, making it run at 30 FPS instead of 25 FPS. It also fixes issues related to combos in combat.
Known issue: Ultimate Jutsus will end prematurely. The only way to fix this is to import all the CCS files from the STR folder of Accel 2's DATA.CVM into the STR folder of Ultimate Ninja 5 and then replace them.
